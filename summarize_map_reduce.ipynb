      "AmeriHealth Caritas Ohio, Inc. (ACOH) and [Health System Name] have entered into a Provider Services Agreement. Under this agreement, Health System and its affiliated providers (collectively \"Health System Providers\") will provide healthcare services to ACOH's members. ACOH, a managed care organization, will compensate the Health System Providers for these services. Both parties acknowledge their authority and qualifications to enter into and fulfill the terms of this agreement.\n",
      "The document outlines the definitions of key terms used in an agreement between ACOH and the Health System. These terms include:\n",
      "\n",

      "- **Provider Manual, Quality Management Program, Specialty Care Provider, Specialty Care Services, Utilization Management Program:** Documents and programs ensuring service quality and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "These definitions set the parameters for the roles, responsibilities, and services provided under the agreement.\n",
      "Health System Providers must maintain necessary licenses and participate in Medicare and Ohio Medicaid programs throughout the agreement term. They must ensure all physicians accept Members and notify ACOH of any new acquisitions or changes. Hospitals must provide services as listed in Appendix A, adhering to ACOH's standards and billing procedures. Physicians must follow ACOH's referral and authorization policies. Providers must submit accurate service statements and encounter data for reporting. They can bill Members for non-covered services if notified in advance but cannot charge for covered services beyond authorized co-payments. Records must be maintained and made available for audits. Providers are forbidden from soliciting Members to other managed care plans and must coordinate benefits with other payors. They should also support fraud and abuse prevention policies.\n",
      "ACOH is obligated to pay Health System Providers for services rendered to eligible members and may offset payments by amounts owed to ACOH, providing at least 30 days' notice. Providers must report and return overpayments within 60 days. ACOH can recover overpayments identified within five years. Payments will match the fees in Appendix B, with no additional charges permissible. Payment policies for services will be established and updated with 30 days' notice. ACOH will provide a Provider Manual and pay Clean Claims as per legal requirements. Providers cannot be excluded for advocating for members, treating costly patients, or refusing services on moral or religious grounds.\n",
      "Health System and Providers must participate in and comply with ACOH’s quality and utilization management programs, which include internal and external quality assessments, member appeals, and adherence to practice guidelines. Providers must allow ACOH to review medical records, both currently and retrospectively, and provide copies upon request. ACOH evaluates providers’ credentials and performance to ensure they meet quality standards. Utilization management requires pre-authorization for certain services and ensures care is medically necessary. Denied claims cannot be billed to ACOH or members, and disputes must go through the provider appeal process. ACOH monitors service quality and may require corrective actions. Providers are responsible for penalties resulting from non-compliance and ACOH may offset payments to cover such penalties.\n",
      "The Health System is required to provide and maintain comprehensive insurance coverage, including professional liability and medical malpractice insurance, for its providers and representatives throughout the term of the agreement. This coverage must meet or exceed legal requirements, and the Health System must verify and notify ACOH of any changes to this coverage. Additionally, the Health System must immediately inform ACOH of any adverse actions or events that could impact its performance under the agreement. Both parties agree to defend, indemnify, and hold each other harmless from any claims, costs, and liabilities arising from breaches of the agreement or negligent actions. This indemnification obligation persists even after the agreement ends.\n",
      "ACOH, Health System, and Health System Providers must comply with state and federal confidentiality laws regarding medical, personal, and business information of Members. They must keep financial, operating, proprietary, or business information confidential and not disclose it to third parties, except as required by regulatory agencies, necessary for performing obligations or enforcing rights under the Agreement, or mandated by law or legal process. If disclosure is legally required, the disclosing party must notify the other party immediately.\n",
      "## Cooperation and Dispute Resolution Summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "ACOH and the Health System will work together to maximize benefits for Members while maintaining high standards of care and managing independently. They will share significant information relevant to their agreement. In case of disputes, both parties will cooperate fully to resolve issues using the provider appeal procedures and ACOH policies, ensuring that service delivery to Members remains uninterrupted.\n",
      "The Agreement starts on the Effective Date and lasts for an initial one-year term, automatically renewing annually unless terminated as specified. Either party can terminate without cause at the end of any term with 120 days' notice, effective the first of the following month. Termination for cause due to material breach requires 90 days' notice, which becomes ineffective if the breach is cured within 60 days. Changes in laws affecting the Agreement allow renegotiation or termination with 90 days' notice if renegotiation fails. Immediate termination by ACOH is possible under specific conditions such as expulsion from Medicaid, loss of liability coverage, suspension of necessary licenses, or jeopardy to member safety. Upon termination, ACOH must inform affected members, and Health System Providers must supply necessary information for claim reimbursements.\n",
      "Schedule 9, attached and incorporated by reference, outlines the necessary terms and conditions to comply with State and Federal statutory and regulatory requirements for the Program. It is sub-numbered for each Program under which Health System Providers offer services. Schedule 9 can be amended according to changes in federal or State laws without needing consent from the Health System or ACOH, becoming effective immediately as indicated in Section 10.3. In case of any conflict between this Agreement's terms and Schedule 9, the terms in Schedule 9 will prevail.\n",
